    "fullStory": "I used to be very anxious walking home from my evening classes. One night, SafePathAI sent a notification about an unlit park on my usual route and rerouted me through a well-lit main street. It's like having a guardian angel on my phone. I can't imagine my commute without it now."

    "snippet": "During a hike, I got disoriented. The offline map and one-tap connection to emergency services were lifesavers. Highly recommended!",
    "fullStory": "I was on a solo hike and took a wrong turn. With no cell service, I started to panic. Thankfully, SafePathAI's offline map feature helped me find my way back to the main trail. Knowing that I could contact help with a single tap, even with a weak signal, gave me immense peace of mind."
